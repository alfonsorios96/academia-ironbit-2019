# Complexity
Describes the interactions between a number of entities. As the number of entities increases, the number of interactions between them would increase exponentially, and it would get to a point where it would be impossible to know and understand all of them

## Cyclomatic complexity
Cyclomatic complexity is a software metric by which to measure the number
of linearly independent paths through the code. More precisely McCabe’s
cyclomatic complexity can be calculated according to the following
definition.

### Definition mathematically 
 ***M = E − N + 2P***
- E = the number of edges of the graph.
- N = the number of nodes of the graph.
- P = the number of connected components.
